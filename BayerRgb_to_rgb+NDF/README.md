# Quantum-Efficiency
Script for Matlab to calculate QE by Raw Bayer data end NDF Filter, captured by Raspberry Pi script.  

Remember to compose your Raw Bayer folder with inside:  
* the *NDF* folder ( please respect the name's folder ) with Monochromator Spectrum response with specific NDFilter.  
* the *OP_X.xlsx* file Optical Density. If you have used a multiple NDFilter don't worry, add all xlsx files.

Useful formula for convert Optical Density to Optical Transmission%:

    OD  = log10(100/OT%)

**Status:** Alpha.
